Web testing with Robot Framework and Selenium2Library
=====================================================

`Robot Framework`_ is a generic test automation framework and Selenium2Library_
is one of the many test libraries that can be used with it. In addition to
showing how Selenium2Library works, this demo introduces Robot Framework test
data syntax, how tests are executed, and how logs and reports look like.

See `project wiki`_ for more information about running the demo, viewing
results, etc. You can also view the tests and generated results through
the wiki without running the demo yourself.
